You do **not** need to sign up for a SamePage account on the web in order to start using SamePage. To get started, visit our [install page.](/install)

However, signing up for a SamePage account on the web will give you access to our `web portal`. The SamePage web portal is where you could manage all things surrounding your SamePage account, including your payment plans, notebooks associated with your account, and more!

To access the web portal, simply navigate to [https://samepage.network/user](/user). If you don't already have an account, you may be redirected to our login page.

## Managing Account

To manage your account, click on your profile on the bottom left and click "Manage Account":

From here, you could edit various user account fields, like your name, your profile photo, your email addresses, and reset your password.

## Payment Plans

To view all of the currently available payment plans, visit our [pricing page](/pricing).

You could manage your plan from the main page of the web portal. It should display what plan you are currently subscribed to, with directions on how to change your plan.
