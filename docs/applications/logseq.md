The SamePage LogSeq extension allows you to connect your LogSeq Graph to other notebooks using the SamePage Network.

A **Notebook** in LogSeq is a graph. The internal [Logseq Docs](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/Contents) and your personal graph are examples of **Notebooks**.

## Installing the Live Version

The Live version of the SamePage extension is available in the LogSeq Marketplace!

First, open the command palette in LogSeq (CMD+Shift+P) and enter `Go to plugins dashboard`.

## Installing the Development version

Note that this version is only intended for contributors to SamePage. Most users will never need to install the development version.

Click [this link](https://samepage.network/extensions/logseq.zip) to download the latest development version of the SamePage extension for Roam.

After downloading the extension from SamePage, extract the zip into a folder. That folder could be stored anywhere on your computer.

In Roam, head to your LogSeq settings, head to the `Advanced` tab toggle on `Development Mode` to enable:
