The SamePage Roam extension allows you to connect your Roam Graph to other notebooks using the SamePage Network.

A **Notebook** in Roam is an online or offline graph. The [Roam Help Graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fCaJekIoX) and your personal graph are examples of **Notebooks**.

## Installing the Live Version

The Live version of the SamePage extension is available in Roam Depot!

First, open the command palette in Roam (CMD+p) and enter `Roam Depot Marketplace`.

## Installing the Development version

Note that this version is only intended for contributors to SamePage. Most users will never need to install the development version.

Click [this link](https://samepage.network/extensions/roam.zip) to download the latest development version of the SamePage extension for Roam.

After downloading the extension from SamePage, extract the zip into a folder. That folder could be stored anywhere on your computer.

In Roam, head to your Roam Depot settings and toggle on `Enable development mode`:

Once you do, click on the folder button and select the folder that you downloaded and extracted.

The extension should automatically load and connect to SamePage!

Because Roam is used in the browser, everytime you load Roam you will need to reload the extension so that it could read it from your file system. This will not be an issue during the **Live** version.
