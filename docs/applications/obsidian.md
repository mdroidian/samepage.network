## Installing the Development version

Note that this version is only intended for contributors to SamePage. Most users will never need to install the development version.

Click [this link](https://samepage.network/extensions/obsidian.zip) to download the latest development version of the SamePage extension for Obsidian.

After downloading the extension from SamePage, extract the zip into a folder. You then have to move that folder within the folder that represents your vault, within the `.obsidian/plugins` directory:

Once you do, you should see SamePage appear in your community plugins section. Click on the toggle next to SamePage to enable the extension:

The extension should automatically load and connect to SamePage!
